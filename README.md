# 5GCity-OpenSourceMano
This repository maintains the ETSI OSM (release 4) components/repos in separate ("orphan") branches.
In case any of those requires major modifications and heavy development, it might make sense to move to a separate repository.
For now they are gathered here mainly for reference purposes, since most of them will not be modified by 5GCity.
