**           Welcome to SONATA's son-emu VM               **
**                 http://sonata-nfv.eu                   **
**                                                        **
** To run the emulator with a simple example topology     **
** and its fake-gatekeeper run the following commands.    **
**                                                        **
** Switch to example folder:                              **
** - cd son-emu/src/emuvim/examples                       **
**                                                        **
** Start the emulator with SONATA's example topology:     **
** - sudo python sonata_y1_demo_topology_1.py             **
**                                                        **
** The emulator will be started and the fake-gatekeeper   **
** API will be accessible on port 5000 from both the      **
** VM and your host machine.                              **
