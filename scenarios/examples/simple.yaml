description:     Simple network scenario consisting of a single VNF connected to an external network
topology: 
  nodes: 
    linux1:                   # vnf/net name in the scenario
      type:      VNF          # VNF, network, external_network (if it is a datacenter network)
      VNF model: linux        # VNF name as introduced in OPENMANO DB
    default: 
      type:      external_network # Datacenter net
      model:     default
  connections: 
    conn1:                   # provide a name for this net or connection
      nodes:
