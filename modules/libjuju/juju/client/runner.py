# Methods are descriptors??
# get is called with params
# set gets called with the result?
# This could let us fake the protocol we want
# while decoupling the protocol from the RPC and the IO/Process context

# The problem is leaking the runtime impl details to the top levels of the API
# with async def By handling the Marshal/Unmarshal side of RPC as a protocol we
# can leave the RPC running to a specific delegate without altering the method
# signatures.  This still isn't quite right though as async is co-op
# multitasking and the methods still need to know not to block or they will
# pause other execution
